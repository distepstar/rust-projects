## rust-projects

# About the repository
This repository shows all the rust collections that I've been trying out recently. As I'm still learning how to write rust code, feel free to let me knon if there are any I can improve on (e.g. algo efficiency, file management, design pattern, etc.).


# Project list
1. rust-chat-server
    - A simple rust echo server that implemented "Tokio", an asyn runtime library to achieve shared state I/O chat.

# How to run the project?
The basic instruction of running the rust projects is shown down below:
```
// first clone the project down
git clone https://github.com/distepstar/rust-projects.git
// cd to the project you want to run (e.g. rust-chat-server)
cd rust-chat-server
// then cargo build and run project
cargo clean
cargo build
cargo run
```
